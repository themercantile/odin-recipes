<h3>Description</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Fairy-bread is thought to have been created by the Aborigine people of Australia. <br>
Archaeologists have discovered evidence of fairy-bread making dating back 40,000 years,<br>
making it the oldest known party treat for kids.<br>
We bring you our modern day fairy-bread recipe to enjoy!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>White Bread <em>2 slivers carved from the main body</em></li>
    <li>Butter or Margarine (if you're an animal)</li>
    <li>Hundred and thousands (not sprinkles)</li>    
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Using your hand, withdraw the bread from the plastic bag.</li>
    <li>Place the bread on a flat surface, like a salt lake.</li>
    <li>Open your container of butter. If it's anything other than Lurpak, you've gone wrong in life somewhere.</li>
    <li>Using a butter knife, score the butter such that there's a shit-load of butter on your bread knife.</li>
    <li>Now that the butter is on your steak knife, spread it in a thick layer on the bread. Remember - <br>
    This is for the kids. They won't have heart problems for years anyway.</li>
    <li>Take your jar of hundreds and thousands and twist the lid in an anti-clockwise direction so that <br>
    the lid loosens along the inclined plane of the jar's top part. The lid will eventually come off.</li>
    <li>Now, using your good arm, take that jar and shake them little critters all on that bread shit.</li>
    <li>Eat the fairy-bread. You don't have kids anyway, you liar.</li>
</ol>
