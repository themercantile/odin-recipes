<h3>Description</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
We're getting a bit more serious with this recipe.<br>
Sausages have been a staple of back yard barbecues since 1666, when Herald the Simple accidentally<br>
removed several fingers scything the fields of Putney and cooked them for his family to cover his clumsiness.<br>
The story goes that Herald's family were suspicious of the sausages from the start because they<br>
were still pretty raw and one had a copper ring on it.<br>
While Herald frantically tried to explain away the finger prints on the 'sausages' by listing 3 reasons they<br>
definitely weren't fingers - The fire was still flaming all over the joint and had spread among the cold area<br>
of the back yard.<br>
Eventually London itself was engulfed in fire. And those finger sausages were cooked darker than a blind man's<br>
black pud. Perfection.<br>
Now that you're aware of the history, here's the recipe for Flambe Sausages.<br>
