read it and then follow it and enjoy some dry white bread.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>White Bread <em>sliced</em></li>
    <li>An air of desperation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Really? Are we doing this now?</li>
    <li>I guess so.</li>
    <li>Go to the pantry and take out the bread.</li>
    <li>Take two (2) slices of white bread out of the bag.</li>
    <li>Seal the bag of bread.</li>
    <li>Walk to your kitchen counter.</li>
    <li>Realise you don't have a toaster.</li>
    <li>Eat the slices of white bread on the couch, crying about your life.</li>    
</ol>
